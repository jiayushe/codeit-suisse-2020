<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Alice wants to send a message to Bob, but she is worried that her messages are being monitored by a third-party. To make sure that they can exchange messages securely, Alice and Bob created a simple transposition encryption algorithm which shuffles the message they are sending into a meaningless sequence of characters. The recipient can then recover the original message by always taking every n-th character of the encrypted message, starting from the first character. More specifically, after taking the first letter of the ciphertext, the next (n-1) letters are skipped and the next letter is taken. This step is repeated until the end of the message is reached, after which the same procedure is repeated starting from the second letter of the ciphertext. This continues until all letters are used.</p>
<p>In this challenge, you will implement the encryption algorithm for this ciper. For a given message, produce the encrypted text (ciphertext). To make the cipher a little bit stronger, you should convert all letters to uppercase and leave out all spaces and non-alphanumeric characters, i.e. the output should only contain letters in A-Z and/or the digits 0-9.</p>

<p>For each message, output the ciphertext that, after using the described decryption algorithm,  will result in the original message (with all spaces as well as non-alphanumeric characters removed and all letters in uppercase).</p>
